TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs
-for the two sections I addedthe classes section and the resources section

1. I added my own bootsrap icons to the services section for example the 
cap makes sense for the learning journey section. 

2. In the testimonials section I changed the quotes of clients to explain some earlier projects
I did and made the image a symbol of the language I used for the assignment.

3. I also made it so the images are buttons in the testimonial and so they become grayscale.

4. In the get started section I switched the side of the form to the left, because I thought it look more visually pleasing to me. 

5. I added a darker box-shadow to the the portfolio project images/boxes, because I thought it would give the page more depth
and make the boxes less static.

6. I changed the comapnies/corporations to socials and some professional ones like linkedin.

7. I made it so all the tabs and buttons would go to the poper sections of the website.

8. I connected my projects to the links at the bottom and the list group in the sectoin that I added.

9. I got rid of the box-shadow on the form in the get started section, and made the box next to it with the colaboration 
information have a shadow-sm just becausse I thought this section didn't need it so it would contrast the 
portfolio images which I put on a the darker box-shadow.

10. I changed the main logo on the nav-bar to a colorful folder which made me think of a portfolio so I thought it would
make more sense.
